## Installation
Clone the repo and cd into the folder:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cgranados16/url-shortener.git
$ cd url-shortener
```
### Starting Docker 
Build the docker containers using docker-compose command:
```sh
$ docker-compose build
```

Then start the containers with:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
Once the container are all up you have to install Laravel dependencies.


### Installing Laravel dependencies

Install Laravel dependencies using composer:
```sh
$ docker-compose exec php composer install
```
After that you just need to generate a key that will be stored in your .env file:
```sh
$ docker-compose exec php php artisan key:generate
```

### Running the app
Make sure all the containers are up:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
Navigate to http://localhost:8080
### Stopping Docker containers
This will stop the docker containers:
```
$ docker-compose kill
```
This will remove all stopped service containers:
```
$ docker-compose rm
```
## Testing
You can add mock data to easily test the API. This will insert 1000 random URLs:
```
$ docker-compose exec php php artisan db:seed
```

## Challenges and Design Decisions
### How to generate short code
The heavy part of this project was to choose a good algorithm to generate the short codes. I based my decision on [this blog](https://medium.com/@adhasmana/system-design-create-a-url-shortening-service-part-2-design-the-write-api-6197c1e0aa1c) by [Abhinav Dhasmana](https://medium.com/@adhasmana).
Our codes are 6 characters long. Let's say we have the following characters to generate our short codes:
-   A-Z(26)
-   a-z(26)
-   0â€“9(10)

62 characters or Base62. I used Base62 instead of Base64 because Base64 has the characters `+` and `/` that are not safe for an URL. With 62 characters and 6 characters long every short code we have

> 62<sup>6</sup> = 56.800.235.584

We have more than 56 billion unique short codes we can store in our database!
We hash the long URL using base64 and take the first 6 characters of that string as our short code.
### Same short code for two URLs
Because we are taking the first 6 characters, it is possible that 2 different URLs use the same short code. I find this bug when trying to add Amazon and Google. Using [https://base62.io/](https://base62.io/)

> https://www.google.com/ = GvB1DW...
> https://www.amazon.com/ = GvB1DW...

As you see, both URL starts with the same code so I got a duplicate error in the DB when trying to add Amazon. The solution was to start with the first 6 characters of the hash and see if there is any other url with that key and take the next 6 characters if the first code is already in use, until you get a new code.

### Top 100 URLs
I had to change the urls table because I forgot to add something to rank the urls. Later I find out that if you add a `+` to any [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) url i.e. [https://bitly.com/1dNVPAW+](https://bitly.com/1dNVPAW+) it shows you information about the link you're being redirected and one of them is a **Click** counter. That gave me the idea to use a click counter as a method to rank every URL.
#### Other Design Decisions

 - I used Laravel because is the PHP Framework I have more experience with.
 - By definition, every URL has the scheme part. This is the *https://* part. If you try to add a url without that part you will get a Bad Request response.
	
## Future improvements
 - [ ] Replace the RDBMS with a non-relational database for better scalability.
 - [ ] Secure the API with OAuth2 tokens i.e. [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/passport)
 - [ ] Custom top instead of top 100 every time. Also the option to select between desc or asc order.
 - [ ] Automatically complete the scheme in the URL if is not present (Web client)
